###KEY VOCABULARY:

ocean acidification – A decrease in ocean water pH due to increasing atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) caused by human activies.

pCO2 – A measurement of the partial pressure of CO2 in solution.

pH – Measurement of how acidic/basic a solution is, based on the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution (pH = -log[H+]).

salinity – Measurement of how much salt is dissolved in a solution.

total alkilinity – DEFINITION

standard curve – DEFINITION

buffer – DEFINITION

titration – DEFINITION

equivalence point – DEFINITION

end point - DEFINITION

Henry's Law – DEFINITION

partial pressure – DEFINITION

---
###KEY BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE: 

- Understand pH (i.e. measurement of [H+])
- Concept of solutions (i.e. mixture of dissolved/mixed chemicals, including gases)
- Basic algebra (ability to solve for an unknown value in a two-side equation)

---
###BACKGROUND:

What is ocean acidification?
 
What drives ocean acidification and why is it a concern?

###CO2 Dissolution 

####Teacher Introduction

Time:

Setup:

Prepare the following solutions:

- 0.001M Na2CO3
- 0.61M NaCl (36g/L)
- Instant Ocean (36g/L)

Activities:

1. Begin class with dry ice in a large beaker of water to generate interest/curiosity.
2. Ask students to describe what is happening and what they know about dry ice - write responses on board (e.g. bubbling, "smoke", cold, sublimation, carbon dioxide).
3. Add dry ice to two different beakers that contain the universal pH indicator and tap water or NaOH solution.
4. Ask students to describe what is happening - write responses on board (e.g. different starting colors, color change, rate of color change, pH).
5. Discuss possible hypotheses to explain what they're observing (e.g. If color change is due to change in temperature and we decrease the temperature, then we should see a color change when the beaker is chilled). Write possible hypotheses on the board.
6. Assign students to groups and have them select (or, assign) a hypothesis to test.
7. Provide groups with a lab sheet to fill out.
8. After hypothesis testing is completed, poll each group to see what their test results were and have them graph their data (time-to-color-change). Results/graphs should be written on board for all groups to see.
9. Initiate dicussion about all results. Should lead to conclusion that gas from dry ice dissolves in solution and changes pH.
