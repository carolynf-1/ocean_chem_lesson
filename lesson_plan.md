###KEY VOCABULARY:

ocean acidification – A decrease in ocean water pH due to increasing atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) caused by human activies.

pCO2 – A measurement of the partial pressure of CO2 in solution.

pH – Measurement of how acidic/basic a solution is, based on the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution (pH = -log[H+]).

salinity – Measurement of how much salt is dissolved in a solution.

total alkilinity – DEFINITION

standard curve – DEFINITION

buffer – DEFINITION

titration – DEFINITION

equivalence point – DEFINITION

end point - DEFINITION

Henry's Law – DEFINITION

partial pressure – DEFINITION

---
###KEY BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE: 

- Understand pH (i.e. measurement of [H+])
- Concept of solutions (i.e. mixture of dissolved/mixed chemicals, including gases)
- Basic algebra (ability to solve for an unknown value in a two-side equation)

---
###BACKGROUND:
