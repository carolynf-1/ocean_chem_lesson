### KEY VOCABULARY:

acidification - A decrease in pH.

ocean acidification – A decrease in ocean water pH due to increasing atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide (CO2), primarily caused by human activies.

pCO2 – A measurement of the partial pressure of CO2 in solution.

pH – Measurement of how acidic/basic a solution is, based on the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution (pH = -log[H+]).

salinity – Measurement of how much salt is dissolved in a solution.

total alkilinity – DEFINITION

standard curve – DEFINITION

buffer – DEFINITION

titration – DEFINITION

equivalence point – DEFINITION

end point - DEFINITION

### KEY BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE: 

- Understand pH (i.e. measurement of [H+])
- Concept of solutions (i.e. mixture of dissolved/mixed chemicals, including gases)
- Basic algebra (ability to solve for an unknown value in a two-side equation)

### CO2 Dissolution 

#### Teacher Introduction

Time:

Setup:

Prepare the following solutions:

- 0.001M Na2CO3
- 0.61M NaCl (36g/L)
- Instant Ocean (36g/L)

Activities:

1. Begin class with dry ice in a large beaker of water to generate interest/curiosity.
2. Ask students to describe what is happening and what they know about dry ice - write responses on board (e.g. bubbling, "smoke", cold, sublimation, carbon dioxide).
3. Add dry ice to two different beakers that contain the universal pH indicator and tap water or NaOH solution.
4. Ask students to describe what is happening - write responses on board (e.g. different starting colors, color change, rate of color change, pH). Let students' ideas propel lesson. 
5. Discuss possible hypotheses to explain what they're observing (e.g. If color change is due to change in temperature and we decrease the temperature, then we should see a color change when the beaker is chilled). Write possible hypotheses on the board. Suggest hypotheses if critical ideas aren't suggested by students.
6. Assign students to groups and have them select (or, assign) a hypothesis to test. Point out available tools for testing (acid solution, base solution, ice, dry ice, hot plate, NaCl solutions, Na2CO3 solution, Instant Ocean solution, etc).
7. Provide groups with a lab sheet to fill out.
8. After hypothesis testing is completed, poll each group to see what their hypotheis and test results were. Have them graph their data (time-to-color-change). Results/graphs should be written on board for all groups to see.
9. When a student mentions a key vocabulary term, write it on the board. If a student is describing a key vocabulary term but no one in the class knows the term, tell the students the term and write it on the board.


Goals:

1. Promote hypothesis-driven, scientific "discovery".
2. Introduce students to key vocabulary:
    - pH
    - carbon dioxide
    - buffer
    - salinity    
3. Introduce students to the effects of carbon dioxide on ocean water pH.

#### Student Lab

Time:

Activities:

- Use Lab Protocol form to record hypotheses being tested.
- Use Lab Protocol form to record solutions, solution volumed, dry ice quantities, and times to various degrees of color changes for a given hypothesis.
- Test hypotheses using various components supplied by instructor.
- Graph data relative to time-to-color-change.
- Share results with rest of class.
- Dicuss own results, as well as other groups' results.

Goals:

- Create hypotheses to guide testing of scientific ideas.
- "Discover":
	- Color change in solutions is due to changes in pH.
	- Carbon dioxide dissolves in solutions.
	- Carbon dioxide decreases pH in solutions.
	- Different amounts of dry ice affect the rate of pH change.
	- Some solutions buffer changes in pH.
	- Ocean water is more complex than just salt water.
- Interpret data and hone critical thinking skills.

#### Class Discussion

Time:

Activities:

- Initiate dicussion about all results. Should lead to various conclusions/realizations:
    1. Carbon dioxide from dry ice dissolves in solution.
    2. Carbon dioxide dissolved in solution causes pH to decrease (i.e. to become more acidic).
    3. Greater amounts of dry ice (i.e. CO2) causes rate of pH change to increase.
    4. Ocean water is more "resistant" to pH decrease than NaCl solution and/or tap water. Can be used to introduce term/concept of a buffer.
  5. Sodium carbonate is "resistant" to pH decrease. Can be used to introduce term/concept of buffer. Also can be tied into similar behavior observed in ocean water.

Goals:

- Define key vocabulary:
	- pH
	- carbon dioxide
	- buffer
	- salinity
- CO2 causes decrease in water pH.
- Different solutions have differing rates of pH change.

### Alkalinity (Buffering Capacity) 

#### Teacher Introduction

Time:

Set up:

- 0.1% methyl orange solution
- serological pipettes
- ring stands/clamps
- 0.1M HCl
- same solutions used in CO2 dissolution activity

Activities:

1. Perform fast "titration" - solely to demonstrate color change of methyl orange.
2. Explain it as a means to quantify buffering capacity (i.e. total alkalinity).
3. Prompte students for hypotheses about which solutions will have better/worse buffering capacities, based on data gathered from CO2 dissolution activity.
