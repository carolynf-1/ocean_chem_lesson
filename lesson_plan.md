LESSON TITLE: Ocean Acidification and Carbonate Chemistry

LEARNING OBJECTIVES: 
- Understand how CO2 affects ocean pH
- Understand how CO2 dissolves in water
- Learn relationship between ocean CO2, alkalinity, salinity, temperature, and pH
- Reinforce knowledge of acid/base chemistry
- Learn how to make/use/interpret standard curves
- Use spreadsheets to record data, create graphs, and automate calculations
- Use a refractometer to measure salinities
- Use a pH meter
