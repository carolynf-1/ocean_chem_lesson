This lesson is developed for use in HS introductory chemistry or environmental science classes. This curriculum draws from concepts taught in the AP Chemistry Ocean Acidification and Alkalinity Titration Lesson Plan developed by H. Palevsky and others at UW and Sammamish High School. This lesson plan is intended to be used alone, following seawater sampling, or in combination with a lesson plan on oyster spat growth at different pH levels. 

Ocean Acidification and Carbonate Chemistry Lesson Plan

Lesson overview:
3 X 90 minute labs? Multiple lab times are necessary to make dilutions, do titrations, and do calculations.
We will measure the alkalinity of seawater by acid titration. 
We will use a standard solution to correct for error

Key take-home concepts:
Environmental context:
Why is an ecological baseline important to measure? (not sure this is addressed)
What sort of change is happening?
Titration:
Strengthen understanding of acids and bases
Buffers resist a change in pH
Seawater is naturally buffered against changes in pH
Standard dilutions: 
Lower salinity seawater has lower amounts of bicarbonate ions and is less buffered to increases in pH
Standard solutions can be used to check accuracy and to correct for error 
CO2 and carbonate chemistry calculations:
The amount of CO2 in seawater can be determined using pH and alkalinity
Saturation state of the molecules that make up shells (calcium carbonate) decreases in lower alkalinity. 

Previous knowledge strongly recommended:
Concept of a solution (a mix of liquids)
Introductory acid-base chemistry 
Know what an H+ ion or proton is
The term ion
(I’ve added in a part that explains some of this, but it is too much information if it is the first time students are learning this)

Background: 

1. The “other CO2 problem.” Pollution of CO2
a. CO2 into water -> H+ ions (change on the acid – base scale)
b. Air -> water
2. A more acidic (less basic) ocean will affect seafood and marine mammals through their food sources. 
a. Many animals in the ocean build skeletons that are more difficult to build in acidic conditions.
b. Ocean water buffers or resists changes in pH because it contains bicarbonate, which is what baking soda is made out of. (Remember baking soda added to vinegar can make a great volcano!)
c. Buffers resist change in pH. 
i. pH relates to the amount of H+ in solution, so a more acidic solution (low pH) has a large number of H+ ions. 
ii. When CO2 dissolves in seawater it produces H+ ions. (see equation 2)
iii. The bicarbonate in seawater binds with the H+ ions, and this keeps the number of H+ ions in the water low, keeping the acidity from becoming lowered. In other words the carbonate buffers in solution resist a change in pH. (see equation 3)
iv. Bicarbonate and carbonic acid are both composed of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, and when they react with water they can interconvert. This can also influence pH and molecules (ions) available for organisms to build things with. We are not going to cover this today, but if you are interested in this, consider taking AP Chemistry! 
d. If ocean water can resist a change in pH, then animals may not be as strongly affected. 
3. We can observe buffers through titration.
4. What is titration? 
a. A titration is used to find out how buffered a solution is, using acid and base chemistry.
b. What are acids and bases (reminder)?
i. Acidity is related to the amount of H+ molecules in a solution.
ii. An acid is a molecule that is able to give up a H+. For example vinegar is an acid! In this lab we will be using a strong acid, HCl, which students may be familiar as a cleaning product. 
iii. A base is a molecule that is able to accept or bind to a H+ and take it out of a solution. For example, soap and baking soda are basic. Today we will be experimenting with baking soda, or bicarbonate, because it is present naturally in seawater. 
iv. Acids and bases react when they combine. You may be familiar with vinegar and baking soda volcanoes or rockets!
c. There are different kinds of titrations. In the titration we will do today we are using a “strong acid” to determine the amount of buffering by our carbonate buffer, also known as a “weak base.”
d. In this case our “strong acid” consists of H+ ions (from HCl) and our “weak base” (bicarbonate in seawater). 
e. The more H+ that can be added to your solution without changing the pH, the more buffered your solution is. 
5. The equivalence point is when equivalent quantities of acid (H+) and base (H+ acceptor).
a. For example when there are 10 molecules of acid and 10 molecules of base.
6. End point
a. The pH of the seawater solution will be tracked with an indicator, methyl orange 
b. Distinguish between equivalence and end point concepts
7.  Standard series
a. make a line using 3 points, make prediction of unknown using line
b. standards: 3 seawaters w/ diff buffering power
c. unknown: 1 seawater of unknown buffering power
d. sea water can have diff buffering power b/c dilution w/ river water, here you’re adding the extra water to dilute

Equations (These are simplified, and would be described in more detail for AP Chemistry!)

Procedure:

PART 1: Dilutions
Use stock seawater solution and make dilutions to achieve a dilute solution of salinity (put in image)
(note – you may either make one dilution that will match your 
seawater sample or may make a set of standards with two dilutions 
to illustrate the relationship between alkalinity and salinity)
1. Salinity is a measure of how salty water is (amount of salt per volume), and is measured in parts per thousand (ppt). Determine the salinity of the stock solution using the refractometer as follows:
a. Place about 1mL of stock solution on the refractometer glass. 
b. Look up through the refractometer at a light and record the salinity at the horizon where the two colors meet (approx.. 33-35ppt): _______________ (include units)
2. We want to dilute some of this very concentrated stock solution in order to have a few different salinity levels to compare. 
3. Label 5 containers as the following: stock, 30 ppt, 25 ppt, 20 ppt, and DI. You will use these throughout the following exercise.
4. We ask, how much stock solution (mL) should be added to DI water in order to make our desired concentration (ppt) and volume (mL) of solution? In order to do this we can use the following equation:
	ConcentrationSolution1 x Volume Solution1 = Concentration Solution2 x Volume Solution2
In this case we can use our desired final solution for “Solution 1” and the stock solution as “Solution 2” as follows:  
For a 30 ppt solution we can find our how much stock solution to add (X ml):
	X ml stock solution * _____ppt stock solution = 
		100 ml desired solution * 30  ppt desired solution
	X (mL of stock solution) = ____________
How much DI water should be added to the stock solution? (hint, if you want a total of 100 ml and you used only say 10 mL of stock solution, you would need to add 90ml of water to make the dilution _________


For a 25 ppt solution how much stock solution should be added?
	X ml stock solution * _____ppt stock solution = 
		100 ml desired solution * 25  ppt desired solution
	X (mL of stock solution) = ____________
	DI water added = ______________
How about for a 20 ppt solution? 
(Show work and units!)
-
-
-
	X (mL of stock solution) = ____________
	DI water added = ______________

Why don’t you summarize with a beautifully organized table. What amounts of stock solution and DI do you want to pour out for each solution?


	






Now it’s time to mix our 3 standard solutions. Use a graduated cylinder to measure the stock solution and the DI water individually before mixing them. 

Now that you have made each of your dilutions, let’s determine salinities of each using the refractometer. How well did you do?









(Possible break point here – can pick up with this last step when doing the titrations lab)
Once you are satisfied with your three standard solutions, store these in closed bottles. 


PART 2: Titration
5. Set up ringstand with 2 clamps to hold burette and pH meter
6. After checking that the stopcock on the burette is closed, move 10-15 mL of acid into burette using a transfer pipet,. If using a burette, especially with a bulb for the first time, practice using it in the sink with DI water. 
7. Find the datasheets you will use for your titrations.
8. Make sure salinity of each standard and seawater solution is recorded. 
9. Measure about 50mL of each of your standards and seawater using a graduated cylinder to be titrated and record this amount. (rinse cylinder with DI water in between measurements)  Place into separate 50 mL beakers labeled with the name of the sample to be titrated. 
10. Calibrate pH meter using the three buffer solutions:
a. Turn on the pH meter
b. Rinse the pH meter using a squeeze bottle with DI water, and dry excess water with a kim wipe, being careful to not scratch the glass on the bottom. 
c. Put the pH meter into the pH 7 buffer. Press “cal” for about 1 second. Keep the pH meter in this buffer until it says “end.”
d. Repeat direction “a” (rinse and dry)
e. Place the pH meter in the pH 4 buffer, press “cal” and wait till the screen says “end.”
f. Repeat direction “a” (rinse and dry)
g. Place the pH meter in the pH 10 buffer, press “cal” and wait till the screen says “end.” 
h. To check that your calibration holds, rinse and dry before placing the pH meter back into the pH 7 buffer. Check that it reads about pH 7! It is OK if it is 0.01 pH unit off. 
i. Rinse and place the pH meter back in it’s cap until you are ready to use it.  
11. Adjust ringstand so that the buret and pH meter are situated appropriately with the beaker
12. Set up first titration
a. Add a few drops of methyl orange using a plastic pipette
b. Use the pH meter to record the sample temperature (deg C)
c. Record the volume of acid in buret
d. Record pH 
e. Add small amount of acid (0.05 – 0.1mL) by turning the buret stopcock quickly in one smooth motion
f. Swirl the solution so that the liquids mix well
g. Record the volume of acid in buret
h. Record pH – make sure the pH meter has settled on the reading
i. Record any big obvious color changes (yes/no). Be sure the solution is completely mixed before noting any changes. 
j. Repeat 8e-8h until color changes dramatically, then do 2 more rounds
13. Repeat steps 8 for each standard and the unknown

PART 3: Putting it all together
A. Determine alkalinity from our end-point titration
1. You will now use the values that you just collected in your worksheet to fill out an excel spreadsheet.
2. Open “Alkalinity Titration Calculations.xls” spreadsheet. Excel spreadsheets have tabs at the bottom that let you switch between different screens.
3. You will enter titrations for 3 standards and a seawater sample, so there is a tab in the excel spreadsheet for each. Click to the tab for the sample that you would like to enter (ex. “Titration data standard 1). 
4. Enter the following into the cells that are marked yellow:
a. Name (Standard #? or Unknown?)
b. Salinity
c. Temperature
d. Acid concentration is 0.100M
e. Measured volume (ml) of sample (This should be about 50mL).
5. Then, record the mL of acid and pH value readings that you took as you increased the amount of titrant acid. You should see the titration curve plotted as you add points. 
6. Note: Remember that alkalinity is buffering capacity. This is measured by determining the amount of protons (H+) added before the buffer is “used up.” If this buffer is no longer able to do it’s job, this will cause the pH to decrease more quickly. We will use a pH of 4.5 as the cutoff to determine when this happens.  
7. On your graph, find where the line crosses 4.5 pH units. Record the volume of acid that is necessary to reach this 4.5 pH value:  __ . ___ ___ . Enter this value in the blue cell under the endpoint Volume (Vend). The alkalinity will automatically be calculated (green cell).
8. Navigate to the tab for the next sample you would like to enter. Repeat steps 4-7 for each titration in the appropriate tab in the spreadsheet. 
9. Navigate to the “Summary” tab. Here all the data typed in are already summarized for you. The pH of the solution is just your initial pH that you recorded before adding any acid. 
10. Put your standard series and unknown on the board as data points where x is salinity and y is alkalinity. 
11. Record your seawater sample alkalinity _________________
12. What was the offset between your measured and known alkalinities? __________________
13. Record you adjusted seawater sample alkalinity given your measurement error ________________
14. What do you think are possible sources of error in your measurement? __________________
B. Calculate pCO2 from pH and alkalinity
1. We discussed pCO2 earlier in this lesson. pCO2, along with pH and alkalinity are considered carbonate chemistry parameters. 
2. If we know any two carbonate chemistry parameters, we can calculate the rest. Today we are going to use pH and alkalinity to calculate pCO2 of our seawater using a computer program called CO2sys. We will also use this program to calculate saturation state of calcium carbonate, which makes up shells and coral skeletons. 
3. Open “CO2sys_OA_HS_curriculum_FINAL.xls.” When it opens, there may be a prompt about macros. If so click enable Macros. 
4. There are a few different pH scales that are used depending on what buffers are used to calibrate the pH meter electrode. You may remember calibrating your pH meter using NBS Buffers (the pink, blue and yellow solutions). 
5. The file will open to the input tab, where you can check that the “pH scale” has “NBS scale (mol/kg-H20)” highlighted. 
6. Navigate to the DATA tab and for each sample enter in the following:
a. Salinity 
b. Temperature recorded when you measured pH for the titration (room temperature, 25C). 
c. Temperature of seawater when collected from ocean or experiment. This is important to enter, even if it is the same as (b). 
d. TA, which is your measured alkalinity
e. pH 
7. Click “Start” in red in the upper left hand corner, then it will ask you a few things and click “yes” for each. 
C. Nicely done! You’ve calculated pCO2 of the seawater!
8. Where and when was your seawater sample collected? _____________
9. What was your sample’s pCO2? __________
10. An aragonite saturation state above 1 means that some kinds of shell that are made of aragonite will not dissolve, and the greater the value the less difficult it is for organisms to build shell. What was your sample’s aragonite saturation state? ______ 
11. If seawater is bubbled with air, or “at equilibrium” with the atmosphere, the seawater will have the same pCO2 as the surrounding atmosphere.
12. Is your measured pCO2 higher or lower than the pre-industrial pCO2 of 280atm? ________
13. Is this value higher or lower than current day pCO2 of 400atm? ________
14. Do you think this water has recently been exposed to the atmosphere or might come from deep in the ocean or somewhere where it is not in contact with our atmosphere? _________________________________________
15. Name a sea creature that would change the pCO2 of the water just by living in it. (Hint, what happens when you breathe?) Would the pCO2 of the water go up or down? ___________________________
16. Can you think of another marine animal or plant that would have the opposite effect on pH? __________________________
17. Do you think it would be easy or difficult for an animal to build a shell in this seawater? What did you measure that would help answer this question? ____________________

D. Baselines and change (2-3 sentences)
1. As the oceans take up more CO2, why might it be important to measure seawater CO2 now and for the next 100 years? 




2. What is a baseline in ecology? Can a baseline shift? 




3. In the Pacific Northwest winds drive water off of the shore, and deep water replaces this surface water, in what is called upwelling. Why do you think a CO2 baseline might be different in different locations? What do you think the baseline is or was here in the Pacific Northwest?




4. How does the physical environment influence animals in plants? Do you think natural variation makes it easier or harder for animals and plants to grow? 





5. What are adaptations that might have evolved to make it possible for animals or plants to live in variable CO2 or pH conditions? Do you think these adaptations will enable animals to persist in more acidic conditions? 






6. What organisms are most at risk to changes in the ocean? Those living at their limits but more evolved to variable conditions, or those living in less extreme conditions but adapted to those conditions?
