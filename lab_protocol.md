Procedure:

PART 1: Dilutions

Use stock seawater solution and make dilutions to achieve a dilute solution of salinity (put in image)
(note – you may either make one dilution that will match your 
seawater sample or may make a set of standards with two dilutions 
to illustrate the relationship between alkalinity and salinity)

1. Salinity is a measure of how salty water is (amount of salt per volume), and is measured in parts per thousand (ppt). Determine the salinity of the stock solution using the refractometer as follows:
  1. Place about 1mL of stock solution on the refractometer glass. 
  2. Look up through the refractometer at a light and record the salinity at the horizon where the two colors meet (approx.. 33-35ppt): _______________ (include units)

2. We want to dilute some of this very concentrated stock solution in order to have a few different salinity levels to compare. 

3. Label 5 containers as the following: stock, 30 ppt, 25 ppt, 20 ppt, and DI. You will use these throughout the following exercise.

4. We ask, how much stock solution (mL) should be added to DI water in order to make our desired concentration (ppt) and volume (mL) of solution? In order to do this we can use the following equation:
	ConcentrationSolution1 x Volume Solution1 = Concentration Solution2 x Volume Solution2

In this case we can use our desired final solution for “Solution 1” and the stock solution as “Solution 2” as follows:  
For a 30 ppt solution we can find our how much stock solution to add (X ml):

	X ml stock solution * _____ppt stock solution =  100 ml desired solution * 30  ppt desired solution

	X (mL of stock solution) = ____________

How much DI water should be added to the stock solution? (hint, if you want a total of 100 ml and you used only say 10 mL of stock solution, you would need to add 90ml of water to make the dilution _________


For a 25 ppt solution how much stock solution should be added?

	X ml stock solution * _____ppt stock solution = 100 ml desired solution * 25  ppt desired solution
	
	X (mL of stock solution) = ____________
	
	DI water added = ______________
How about for a 20 ppt solution? 
(Show work and units!)

	X (mL of stock solution) = ____________
	
	DI water added = ______________

Why don’t you summarize with a beautifully organized table. What amounts of stock solution and DI do you want to pour out for each solution?


Now it’s time to mix our 3 standard solutions. Use a graduated cylinder to measure the stock solution and the DI water individually before mixing them. 

Now that you have made each of your dilutions, let’s determine salinities of each using the refractometer. How well did you do?


Once you are satisfied with your three standard solutions, store these in closed bottles. 


PART 2: Titration

5. Set up ringstand with 2 clamps to hold burette and pH meter
6. After checking that the stopcock on the burette is closed, move 10-15 mL of acid into burette using a transfer pipet,. If using a burette, especially with a bulb for the first time, practice using it in the sink with DI water. 
7. Find the datasheets you will use for your titrations.
8. Make sure salinity of each standard and seawater solution is recorded. 
9. Measure about 50mL of each of your standards and seawater using a graduated cylinder to be titrated and record this amount. (rinse cylinder with DI water in between measurements)  Place into separate 50 mL beakers labeled with the name of the sample to be titrated. 
10. Calibrate pH meter using the three buffer solutions:
  1. Turn on the pH meter
  2. Rinse the pH meter using a squeeze bottle with DI water, and dry excess water with a kim wipe, being careful to not scratch the glass on the bottom. 
  3. Put the pH meter into the pH 7 buffer. Press “cal” for about 1 second. Keep the pH meter in this buffer until it says “end.”
  4. Repeat direction “a” (rinse and dry)
  5. Place the pH meter in the pH 4 buffer, press “cal” and wait till the screen says “end.”
  6. Repeat direction “a” (rinse and dry)
  7. Place the pH meter in the pH 10 buffer, press “cal” and wait till the screen says “end.” 
  8. To check that your calibration holds, rinse and dry before placing the pH meter back into the pH 7 buffer. Check that it reads about pH 7! It is OK if it is 0.01 pH unit off. 
  9. Rinse and place the pH meter back in it’s cap until you are ready to use it.  
11. Adjust ringstand so that the buret and pH meter are situated appropriately with the beaker
12. Set up first titration
  1. Add a few drops of methyl orange using a plastic pipette
  2. Use the pH meter to record the sample temperature (deg C)
  3. Record the volume of acid in buret
  4. Record pH 
  5. Add small amount of acid (0.05 – 0.1mL) by turning the buret stopcock quickly in one smooth motion
  6. Swirl the solution so that the liquids mix well
  7. Record the volume of acid in buret
  8. Record pH – make sure the pH meter has settled on the reading
  9. Record any big obvious color changes (yes/no). Be sure the solution is completely mixed before noting any changes. 
  10. Repeat 8e-8h until color changes dramatically, then do 2 more rounds
13. Repeat steps 8 for each standard and the unknown

PART 3: Putting it all together

A. Determine alkalinity from our end-point titration

1. You will now use the values that you just collected in your worksheet to fill out an excel spreadsheet.
2. Open “Alkalinity Titration Calculations.xls” spreadsheet. Excel spreadsheets have tabs at the bottom that let you switch between different screens.
3. You will enter titrations for 3 standards and a seawater sample, so there is a tab in the excel spreadsheet for each. Click to the tab for the sample that you would like to enter (ex. “Titration data standard 1). 
4. Enter the following into the cells that are marked yellow:
  1. Name (Standard #? or Unknown?)
  2. Salinity
  3. Temperature
  4. Acid concentration is 0.100M
  5. Measured volume (ml) of sample (This should be about 50mL).
5. Then, record the mL of acid and pH value readings that you took as you increased the amount of titrant acid. You should see the titration curve plotted as you add points. 
6. Note: Remember that alkalinity is buffering capacity. This is measured by determining the amount of protons (H+) added before the buffer is “used up.” If this buffer is no longer able to do it’s job, this will cause the pH to decrease more quickly. We will use a pH of 4.5 as the cutoff to determine when this happens.  
7. On your graph, find where the line crosses 4.5 pH units. Record the volume of acid that is necessary to reach this 4.5 pH value:  __ . ___ ___ . Enter this value in the blue cell under the endpoint Volume (Vend). The alkalinity will automatically be calculated (green cell).
8. Navigate to the tab for the next sample you would like to enter. Repeat steps 4-7 for each titration in the appropriate tab in the spreadsheet. 
9. Navigate to the “Summary” tab. Here all the data typed in are already summarized for you. The pH of the solution is just your initial pH that you recorded before adding any acid. 
10. Put your standard series and unknown on the board as data points where x is salinity and y is alkalinity. 
11. Record your seawater sample alkalinity _________________
12. What was the offset between your measured and known alkalinities? __________________
13. Record you adjusted seawater sample alkalinity given your measurement error ________________
14. What do you think are possible sources of error in your measurement? __________________

B. Calculate pCO2 from pH and alkalinity

1. We discussed pCO2 earlier in this lesson. pCO2, along with pH and alkalinity are considered carbonate chemistry parameters. 
2. If we know any two carbonate chemistry parameters, we can calculate the rest. Today we are going to use pH and alkalinity to calculate pCO2 of our seawater using a computer program called CO2sys. We will also use this program to calculate saturation state of calcium carbonate, which makes up shells and coral skeletons. 
3. Open “CO2sys_OA_HS_curriculum_FINAL.xls.” When it opens, there may be a prompt about macros. If so click enable Macros. 
4. There are a few different pH scales that are used depending on what buffers are used to calibrate the pH meter electrode. You may remember calibrating your pH meter using NBS Buffers (the pink, blue and yellow solutions). 
5. The file will open to the input tab, where you can check that the “pH scale” has “NBS scale (mol/kg-H20)” highlighted. 
6. Navigate to the DATA tab and for each sample enter in the following:
  1. Salinity 
  2. Temperature recorded when you measured pH for the titration (room temperature, 25C). 
  3. Temperature of seawater when collected from ocean or experiment. This is important to enter, even if it is the same as (b). 
  4. TA, which is your measured alkalinity
  5. pH 
7. Click “Start” in red in the upper left hand corner, then it will ask you a few things and click “yes” for each. 

C. Nicely done! You’ve calculated pCO2 of the seawater!

8. Where and when was your seawater sample collected? _____________
9. What was your sample’s pCO2? __________
10. An aragonite saturation state above 1 means that some kinds of shell that are made of aragonite will not dissolve, and the greater the value the less difficult it is for organisms to build shell. What was your sample’s aragonite saturation state? ______ 
11. If seawater is bubbled with air, or “at equilibrium” with the atmosphere, the seawater will have the same pCO2 as the surrounding atmosphere.
12. Is your measured pCO2 higher or lower than the pre-industrial pCO2 of 280atm? ________
13. Is this value higher or lower than current day pCO2 of 400atm? ________
14. Do you think this water has recently been exposed to the atmosphere or might come from deep in the ocean or somewhere where it is not in contact with our atmosphere? _________________________________________
15. Name a sea creature that would change the pCO2 of the water just by living in it. (Hint, what happens when you breathe?) Would the pCO2 of the water go up or down? ___________________________
16. Can you think of another marine animal or plant that would have the opposite effect on pH? __________________________
17. Do you think it would be easy or difficult for an animal to build a shell in this seawater? What did you measure that would help answer this question? ____________________

D. Baselines and change (2-3 sentences)

1. As the oceans take up more CO2, why might it be important to measure seawater CO2 now and for the next 100 years? 

2. What is a baseline in ecology? Can a baseline shift? 

3. In the Pacific Northwest winds drive water off of the shore, and deep water replaces this surface water, in what is called upwelling. Why do you think a CO2 baseline might be different in different locations? What do you think the baseline is or was here in the Pacific Northwest?




4. How does the physical environment influence animals in plants? Do you think natural variation makes it easier or harder for animals and plants to grow? 





5. What are adaptations that might have evolved to make it possible for animals or plants to live in variable CO2 or pH conditions? Do you think these adaptations will enable animals to persist in more acidic conditions? 






6. What organisms are most at risk to changes in the ocean? Those living at their limits but more evolved to variable conditions, or those living in less extreme conditions but adapted to those conditions?
